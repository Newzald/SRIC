                        Most universities in the United States have large endowments that they invest in stocks. Where these funds are large enough, investment and divestment &#8212; as acts in themselves &#8212; can influence the decisions of companies. Bard's funds are not large enough to influence companies in this way, so we use a different approach to engage with companies. Bard's Socially Responsible Investment Committee writes Shareholder Resolutions that demand business practices reflect the values of the Bard student body. The resolutions offer alternatives that we deem both more ethical as well as more profitable. We welcome Bard students to propose new companies we can invest in and whom we could engage in a shareholder resolution campaign. Divestment or passive investment proposals will rarely be considered.

                        A shareholder resolution is a proposal submitted by shareholders for a change in the usual practices of the company. Shareholder resolutions usually focus on issues of corporate governance, like executive compensation or corporate social responsibility issues. Although almost all shareholder resolutions are nonbinding, corporates tend to follow through on the results of a resolution so as to avoid issues with reputational risk. Therefore, shareholder resolutions offer an effective way to increase corporate social responsibility.
